**What does this mean?**
- `on: push` → Run this action whenever you push code to the `main` branch
- `on: workflow_dispatch` → Also lets you trigger it manually with a button
- `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` → Use a Linux computer (GitHub provides this for free)
- `name: 23f3003439@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` → This is the step name containing your email (required by the assignment)
- `run: echo "Hello, world!"` → The actual command the robot runs

### Step 5: Save (Commit) the File

1. Click the green **"Commit changes..."** button in the top right
2. A popup appears — just click **"Commit changes"** again to confirm
3. This saves the file AND automatically triggers the action (because you just pushed to `main`!)

### Step 6: Watch It Run

1. Click the **"Actions"** tab again
2. You should see a workflow run appearing (possibly with an orange spinning circle = running, or green checkmark = done)
3. Click on it to see the details and confirm your email step appears
